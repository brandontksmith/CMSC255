These programs were written and developed for a course I took at Virginia Commonwealth
University (CMSC 255). They are math intensive, which is to be expected as a CS major.

THIS IS USEFUL IF:

	YOU HAVE WRITTEN A PROGRAM AND WANT TO TEST THE RESULTS WITH ANOTHER
	YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO; USE THIS AS A REFERENCE TO HELP YOU

DISCLAIMER:

	DO NOT COPY AND TURN THESE PROGRAMS IN AS YOUR OWN. THAT IS CHEATING, AND YOU
	WILL NOT LEARN BY DOING THIS. I HAVE ADDED THESE ON GITHUB AS A REFERENCE AND
	CHANCES ARE IF YOU FIND THIS, AND ARE A STUDENT AT VCU TAKING CMSC 255 OR YOU
	ARE A STUDENT AT ANOTHER UNIVERSITY WITH A SIMILAR ASSIGNMENT, THEN THERE IS
	SOMEONE ELSE IN YOUR CLASS WHO WILL SEE THIS TOO.
